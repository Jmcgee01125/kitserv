.Fn kitserv_api_save_state "struct kitserv_client*" "void* state"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy kitserv_api_save_state()
function saves the given
.Em state
variable in the client information.
.Pp
This is the same state variable passed to the endpoint's handler function,
which is NULL when first called. Using this function allows an endpoint to
recognize that it has already done some processing for a client, e.g., when
.Sy kitserv_api_read_payload()
had previously blocked.
