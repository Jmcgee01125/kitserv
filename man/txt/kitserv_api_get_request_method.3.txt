kitserv_api_get_request_method(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     enum kitserv_http_method
     kitserv_api_get_request_method(struct kitserv_client*);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_get_request_method() function returns the request method
     that the client made.

     Note that the API endpoint already defines the endpoint before the func-
     tion is called. This function exists to support registering the same
     function for multiple endpoints, or for differentiating between GET and
     HEAD. Note that Kitserv will make sure that the body is not sent for a
     HEAD request, but early detection can allow API endpoints from generating
     the response in the first place if it can serve the HEAD request without
     doing so.

     The supported methods are as follows:

	 HTTP_GET

	 HTTP_HEAD

	 HTTP_POST

	 HTTP_PUT

	 HTTP_DELETE

RETURN VALUE
     This function returns the HTTP method as an enum.
