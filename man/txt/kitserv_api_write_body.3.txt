kitserv_api_write_body(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     int
     kitserv_api_write_body(struct kitserv_client*, char* buf, char* buflen);

     int
     kitserv_api_write_body_fmt(struct kitserv_client*, const char* fmt, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_write_body() function writes buflen bytes from buf into
     the response body.

     The kitserv_api_write_body_fmt() function writes a printf-style format
     string into the response body.

     Unless indicated otherwise, Kitserv will send the entire response body to
     the client. To send a subset, use kitserv_api_set_send_range(). Note that
     Kitserv will always send until the end of the buffer, so setting the send
     range will only affect the start offset.

     Note that, if Kitserv has been indicated to send a file, that takes
     precedence over sending this body buffer. For more information, see
     kitserv_api_send_file().

RETURN VALUE
     On success, these functions return the number of bytes written. On fail-
     ure, they return -1, setting errno.

ERRORS
     These functions shall fail if:

     ENOMEM  The response body buffer needed to expand, but space was not
	     available.
