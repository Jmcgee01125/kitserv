kitserv_api_set_send_range(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     int
     kitserv_api_set_send_range(struct kitserv_client*, off_t from, off_t to);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_set_send_range() function sets the range to send the re-
     sponse from, byte-inclusive.

     Note that to is ignored when sending a request from a body (not a file).
     Kitserv will always send until the end of the buffer.

     It is the endpoint's responsibility to ensure that to does not exceed the
     length of the file being sent.

     This function does not set the content-range header on the response. Use
     kitserv_http_header_add().

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns 0. On failure, this function returns
     -1, setting errno.

ERRORS
     These functions shall fail if:

     EINVAL  Either from or to is negative.
