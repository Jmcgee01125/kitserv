kitserv_api_get_request_modified_since_difference(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     int
     kitserv_api_get_request_modified_since_difference(struct kitserv_client*,
	 double* difference, time_t time);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_get_request_modified_since_difference() function finds
     the difference between the requested if-modified-since time and the given
     time.

     The calculation performed is time minus the time given in the header. So,
     a negative difference indicates that the if-modified-since header has
     succeeded (that the resource was modified after time)

RETURN VALUE
     On success, this function returns 0. On failure, this function returns -1
     but does not set errno.

ERRORS
     This function shall fail if:

	 The request did not contain an if-modified-since header.

	 The if-modified-since header was malformed.

     In either case, the endpoint should treat the request as if the client
     did not make an if-modified-since request.
