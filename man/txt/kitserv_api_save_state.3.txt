kitserv_api_save_state(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     void
     kitserv_api_save_state(struct kitserv_client*, void* state);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_save_state() function saves the given state variable in
     the client information.

     This is the same state variable passed to the endpoint's handler func-
     tion, which is NULL when first called. Using this function allows an end-
     point to recognize that it has already done some processing for a client,
     e.g., when kitserv_api_read_payload() had previously blocked.
