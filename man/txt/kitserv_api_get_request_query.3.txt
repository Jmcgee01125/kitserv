kitserv_api_get_request_query(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     const char*
     kitserv_api_get_request_query(struct kitserv_client*);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_get_request_query() function returns a pointer to a null-
     terminated string for the client's request query. If the client did not
     put a query in the request, this function will return NULL.

     The query string returned is unparsed, but the leading ? is removed. So,
     this function returns (on success) a pointer to an &-delimited list of
     the query's key-value pairs.

RETURN VALUE
     A pointer to the client's query, or NULL if not found.
