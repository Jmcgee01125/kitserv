kitserv_api_set_response_status(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     void
     kitserv_api_set_response_status(struct kitserv_client*,
	 enum kitserv_http_response_status);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_set_response_status() function sets the given response
     status on the client.

     Until the response status has been changed from its default value,
     HTTP_X_RESP_STATUS_UNSET, Kitserv will continue to call the endpoint han-
     dler. Once it has been set, returning from the handler will trigger Kit-
     serv to send the response.

     If a function has changed the response status (for example,
     http_handle_static_path() on error), this function may be used to revert
     to HTTP_X_RESP_STATUS_UNSET to prevent replying.

     The supported statuses are as follows:

	 HTTP_X_RESP_STATUS_UNSET

	 HTTP_200_OK

	 HTTP_206_PARTIAL_CONTENT

	 HTTP_304_NOT_MODIFIED

	 HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST

	 HTTP_403_PERMISSION_DENIED

	 HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND

	 HTTP_408_REQUEST_TIMEOUT

	 HTTP_413_CONTENT_TOO_LARGE

	 HTTP_414_URI_TOO_LONG

	 HTTP_416_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE

	 HTTP_431_REQUEST_HEADER_FIELDS_TOO_LARGE

	 HTTP_500_INTERNAL_ERROR

	 HTTP_501_NOT_IMPLEMENTED

	 HTTP_503_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE

	 HTTP_505_VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED

	 HTTP_507_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE

     HTTP_405_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED is also supported, but is reserved for inter-
     nal use. Endpoints should enforce method restrictions using the API tree.
