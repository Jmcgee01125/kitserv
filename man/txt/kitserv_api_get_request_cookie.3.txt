kitserv_api_get_request_cookie(3)

SYNOPSIS
     library "kitserv"

     #include <kitserv.h>

     const char*
     kitserv_api_get_request_cookie(struct kitserv_client*, const char* key);

     const char*
     kitserv_api_get_request_cookie_n(struct kitserv_client*, const char* key,
	 int keylen);

DESCRIPTION
     The kitserv_api_get_request_cookie() function retrieves a cookie from the
     request headers, or NULL if no cookie by that name exists.

     The kitserv_api_get_request_cookie_n() function retrieves a cookie with a
     precalculated key length (not cookie value length). Kitserv skips cookies
     if the key length does not match, so this function removes the (small)
     overhead of calculating the length of the key.

     Because Kitserv preallocates storage for all request information, there
     is a hard limit on the number of cookies that Kitserv will store. If a
     client sends more cookies, it is possible that the cookie with the re-
     quested key is discarded. The maximum number of cookies is defined such
     that most browsers will not send that many cookies in the first place,
     which should prevent this issue. Regardless, API endpoints relying on
     cookies should avoid setting too many, especially if hosted on a subdo-
     main.

RETURN VALUE
     On success, these functions return a pointer to a null-terminated cookie
     value string or NULL if no cookie with that key exists. On failure, they
     return NULL, setting errno.

ERRORS
     These functions shall fail if:

     EINVAL  The key is NULL, or the keylen is invalid.
