Kitserv(1) -- Simple Fully-Static File Server

SYNOPSIS
     kitserv -w webdir [-p port] [-s slots] [-t threads] [-f fallback]
     [-r root_fallback] [-4] [-6] [-h]

DESCRIPTION
     Kitserv is a simple static file server to host any given directory as a
     static web server.

     Kitserv does not require anything more than its executable to run - it is
     not a daemon nor does it create any external dependencies such as log
     files (information is sent to standard output streams).

     Shut down Kitserv by sending SIGINT or SIGTERM.

OPTIONS
     -w webdir
	     Path to directory that will be hosted.

     [-p port]
	     Port to run on.

     [-s slots]
	     Number of connection slots in total. Kitserv preallocates all
	     slots, so expansion is not possible. Note that clients may expe-
	     rience connection issues as the load nears its peak, though Kit-
	     serv will do its best to serve every client it can.

     [-t threads]
	     Number of threads to use to serve clients.

     [-f fallback]
	     File to serve when the requested path is not accessible. This lo-
	     cation is relative to webdir.

     [-r root_fallback]
	     File to serve when the requested path is /. This location is rel-
	     ative to webdir.

     [-4]    Bind IPv4 address only.

     [-6]    Bind IPv6 address only. If enabled on the system, use dual bind-
	     ing.

     [-h]    Show help information and configured default values.

EXAMPLES
     Run a dual-bound server on the directory `./web`
	   kitserv -w ./web -6

     Run an IPv4-only server with support for 10000 clients using 16 threads
     on the directory `./web`
	   kitserv -w ./web -t 16 -s 10000 -4

     Run a server with fallbacks enabled on the directory `./web`
	   kitserv -w ./web -f /200.html -r /index.html
